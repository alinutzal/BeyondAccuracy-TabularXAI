# @package _global_
# Default TabPFN configuration
# TabPFN is a pre-trained transformer model for small tabular classification tasks

model:
  name: TabPFN
  params:
    # Device to run on (auto-detected if not specified)
    device: cuda
    
    # Number of ensemble configurations (higher = better but slower)
    # Recommended: 16-64 for balance, 1-8 for speed, 64-256 for accuracy
    N_ensemble_configurations: 32
    
    # Random seed for reproducibility
    random_state: 42
    
    # Note: TabPFN is a pre-trained model and doesn't require traditional training
    # It performs in-context learning on the fly
    # Limitations:
    #   - Max 10,000 training samples
    #   - Max 100 features
    #   - Binary or multi-class classification only
